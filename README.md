## Process
- Imported data from Excel across three tables: Sales, Products, and Customers
- Cleaned and transformed the data using Power Query for consistency and accuracy
- Created relationships across tables using customer and product IDs to enable cross-filtering
- Designed custom DAX measures for Total Sales, Quantity Sold, and Total Discount Given
 Built interactive visuals:
- Funnel chart for top customers by quantity
- Donut charts for most and least sold products
- Bubble & bar charts for pricing, product categories, and unit price
- Line chart for gender and birth year-based purchase patterns
- Applied filters and slicers to enhance interactivity and dynamic insights
- Optimized the layout for clarity, allowing one-page summary analysis

## Project InsightsProject Insights
- Asparagus was the most sold and most expensive product, driving significant revenue
- Lemon was the least sold product, indicating possible low demand or visibility
- Core customers like Amina Loo and Corelia Brent accounted for the largest share of purchases
- Discounts totaling 266.60 were distributed across 952 units — showing an effort to boost sales volume
- Gender and birth year data revealed that purchases peaked among customers born between 1950–1980, with slightly higher activity among males
- Fruits dominated the high-value product category compared to vegetables, signaling better profitability in that segment
- Identified a need to review low-selling products like Lemon, Peach, and Cranberry for potential phase-out or re-marketing


 ## Conlcusion
This Power BI dashboard provided a comprehensive view of sales performance, customer behavior, and product-level profitability for a fruit and vegetable business. Key insights revealed high-performing products like Asparagus, underperformers like Lemon, and the importance of targeted discounts. The visual breakdown by gender, birth year, and region allowed for deeper customer segmentation.
